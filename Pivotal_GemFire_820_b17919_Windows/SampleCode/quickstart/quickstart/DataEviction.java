/**
 * This example shows cached data eviction. Use eviction to keep a region size
 * in check when you can easily get the data again from an outside source. If
 * you have data that is hard to retrieve again, you might want to use data
 * overflow. (See the DataOverflow example.) The mechanism for deciding when and
 * what to remove from memory is the same for overflow and standard eviction.
 * Standard eviction just destroys the entry instead of copying it out to disk.
 * Both use a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction controller to decide what to
 * remove from memory. Please refer to the quickstart guide for instructions on
 * how to run this example.
