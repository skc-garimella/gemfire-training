/**
 * DistributedLocking.java demonstrates the user of distributed locking to
 * manage concurrent access to resources. In this case, the resource used is a
 * distributed, non-global data region, but it could be a file or any other
 * resource whose use is contended. The program creates a named lock service and
 * then tries 5 times to get a lock from it. Each time it succeeds, it updates a
 * key in the region and reports the update to the screen. This program is
 * intended to be run as two concurrent runs, so there is contention created for
 * the lock. See the quickstart guide for run instructions.
 * </p>
