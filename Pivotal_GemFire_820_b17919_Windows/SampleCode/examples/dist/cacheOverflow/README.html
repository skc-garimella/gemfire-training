<P>The <b>cacheOverflow</b> <a href="CacheOverflow.java">example</a> program demonstrates the "overflow" 
feature of GemFire cache regions. The example is located in the GemFire 
installation under <code>examples/dist/cacheOverflow</code>.</P>


<P>Before running this application, you need to start a terminal session and configure its environment according to the instructions provided under the GemFire installation 
in <a href="../../EnvSetup.html">examples/EnvSetup.html</a>. </P>

<P>After the environment has been set, change directory to <code>examples/dist/cacheOverflow</code> in the SampleCode distribution directory. </P>

<P>You can run the <code>cacheOverflow</code> example
  with no command line arguments to obtain usage information.</P>
<pre>

usage: java -cp "$GEMFIRE/SampleCode/examples/dist/classes:$GEMFIRE/lib/server-dependencies.jar" cacheOverflow.CacheOverflow [options] args

Where [options] are
  -synchronous       Writes to disk are synchronous
  -backup            Backup the region data on disk (data will be written
                     to disk as soon as it is added to the region). Restarting
                     the VM with the -backup flag will recover it's contents.
  -validate          Instead of populating a region validates its contents.
  -disableCompaction Save the old backup files instead of compacting them

Where args are
  threads            Number of threads adding to region
  arrays             Number of 8 kilobyte arrays added by each thread
  overflowThreshold  Number of megabytes of region data that can reside
                     in the VM before overflowing to disk
  maxOplogSize       Number of megabytes of region data that can be written
                     to a backup file before rolling over to a new file
  dir+               One or more directories in which to write region data
</pre>

<P>The <code>cacheOverflow</code> example launches one or more threads that
populate a GemFire region with 8 kilobyte chunks of data (<code>long</code>
arrays of size 1024).  Once the amount of region data exceeds the specified
threshold, the data is overflowed to disk, thus allowing the
logical size of the region to exceed the amount of heap space in the
VM.
<P>Enter the following command exactly as shown. The call puts a total of 20*100*8K = 16MB of data into 
  a region with a size limit of 1 megabyte, so 15 megabytes are 
  overflowed (into a 30 megabyte file in the current working directory) 
  as the threads run. 
<pre>
    java -cp "$GEMFIRE/SampleCode/examples/dist/classes:$GEMFIRE/lib/server-dependencies.jar" cacheOverflow.CacheOverflow 20 100 1 30 .
</pre> 
<p>When the threads finish, the program exits. This forces a cache close and 
region destruction.</P>
<p> If you run the same command with the -backup flag, it will store all of the entries
on disk. It will still keep 1 megabyte in the in memory cache. <p>
<pre>
    java -cp "$GEMFIRE/SampleCode/examples/dist/classes:$GEMFIRE/lib/server-dependencies.jar" cacheOverflow.CacheOverflow -backup 20 100 1 30 .
</pre>
<p>
Running the program with the -backup flag again will recover the region contents from disk.
Run it with both the -backup and -verify flags to make sure the data was recovered.
<pre>
    java -cp "$GEMFIRE/SampleCode/examples/dist/classes:$GEMFIRE/lib/server-dependencies.jar" cacheOverflow.CacheOverflow -backup -validate 20 100 1 30 .
</pre>
<P>While the program itself does not have very interesting output,
there are a number of GemFire statistics that are worth observing. The
example program creates its own statistics in WorkerStats.java. It keeps
track of the number of bytes it has added to the cache (the
<code>bytesAdded</code> statistic of the <code>WorkerStats</code>). GemFire
itself tracks a several of stats related to cache operations. You can see
the number of region entry values that have been overflowed to disk
(the <code>lruEvictions</code> statistic of
<code>MemLRUStatistics</code>, and the amount of time that is spent
writing data to disk (the <code>writeTime</code> statistic of
<code>DiskRegionStatistics</code>).</P>
<p>
The program's statistics are archived in a file named <code>statArchive.gfs</code>. The optional VSD tool can be used to view these statistics. (VSD is provided in the product distribution under <code>$GEMFIRE/tools/vsd</code>. See <a href="http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/userguide/index.html#gemfire_tools/vsd/chapter_overview.html">Visual Statistics Display documentation</a> for more information.) Run this command to the view the statistics:
<pre>
  prompt> $GEMFIRE/tools/vsd/bin/vsd statArchive.gfs
</pre>
</p>

<P>By default, the <code>cacheOverflow</code> program runs as a standalone GemFire application, 
  meaning it does not join a distributed system, but only creates a 
  cache. 
  The <code>CacheOverflow</code> program can be
  configured to join a distributed system by setting certain
  distribution-related system properties as outlined in the
  online documentation for the <code>DistributedSystem</code> class and
  in the <I>Pivotal GemFire User's Guide</I>.</P>
